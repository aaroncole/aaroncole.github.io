The last great Stones album.  Every track. Though released in 1981, most of the tracks were outtakes from the 70s.  Their greatest decade.

I remember playing this as loud as our stereo could go while home alone on a Friday afternoon back then.  It wasn't until Waiting On A Friend ended that I finally heard my Dad knocking at the door.  He was here to pick me up for the weekend and had given up trying to get me to hear him.  I guess he waited until the album was done.
