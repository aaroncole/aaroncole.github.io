The boys and I had an awesome overnight at Pinnacles National Park with the Scouts this weekend. It was our first camping trip with the troop and while we will pack better next time (ear plugs), it was a great success. Elliot even got to attend even though he’s got a few more years in Cub Scouts before he can join the troop.

There was a great brook right behind our campsites. Well, great until the bullfrogs came out at night :)
