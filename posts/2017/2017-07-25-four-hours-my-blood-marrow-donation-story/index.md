In August of 2015 I walked into a clinic at Stanford Hospital and sat for four hours while a machine silently collected white blood cells.  During that time I had a nice conversation with the nurse who ran the procedure and then went home with my wife.  Four hours.  
  
Later that day, in another hospital, those same blood cells were given to a very sick little boy.  This Christmas I received a card from the boy's parents.  He's doing well.

For four hours of my time and some minor discomfort, I was able to help save a life.  

## Still not sure?  This is my story.

In February 2012, a former colleague of mine posted to Facebook about a sick family member and how easy it was to get on the bone marrow registry.  I had always meant to sign up and now I was given a link to click.  A few days later I received a kit in the mail with some Q-Tips.  I swabbed my cheek, mailed the kit back, and figured that was probably going to be the extent of my involvement.  The website had said that the vast majority of registrants are never selected.

Fast-forward two years later.   Of all the places, I'm standing in line at Walt Disney World when my phone rings.  It's someone from Be The Match.  They have identified me as a possible match and would I be willing to take a blood test to help confirm?  The next week, I walk into a lab at home, they take a quick draw, and I'm off to work.

Unfortunately, I hear back a few weeks later that I'm not a match.  While disappointed, I figure at least I tried and assume that will be the end of my donation story.  Because most people don't get selected, right?

The next time my phone rang, I was walking to a meeting at work.  This time I'm told that I'm a match.  I'm guessing the previous blood test helped.  After agreeing to move forward, we discuss the process
